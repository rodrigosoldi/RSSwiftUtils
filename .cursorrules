# RSSwiftUtils Project Rules

## Build and Deploy Rule

When the user says "build and deploy" or "bd", execute the following sequence:

1. Check git status for changes
2. If there are changes:
   - Automatically update or create README.md with:
     * a detailed project description
     * how to use     
     * Update any version references if needed
     * Ensure all information is current and accurate
   - Add all changes to staging with `git add -A`
   - Get the latest tag number and increment it by 1
   - Create a commit with a descriptive message about the changes
   - Create a new tag with the incremented version number
   - Push both the commit and tag to the remote repository
3. Provide a summary of what was completed

This rule automates the complete build, database generation, README update, and deployment process.
